# ğŸš€ Boost Your Development Workflow with Custom NPX Commands! âš¡

Iâ€™ve created two custom NPX commands that instantly set up full-stack boilerplatesâ€”saving time and making project kick-offs super smooth!  

---

## âœ¨ Client Side (Frontend)

Spin up a React app (Vite) with just one command:  


# npx create-react-tailwind-daisy #

Includes:

ğŸ”¹ Tailwind CSS

ğŸ”¹ DaisyUI

ğŸ”¹ Firebase

ğŸ”¹ React Router

ğŸ”¹ React Helmet

 ## Sometime it can be isuee then run command : npm install tailwindcss @tailwindcss/vite

âœ¨ Server Side (Backend)

Instant setup for a Node.js Express server:

# npx create-express-server-starter #

Includes:

ğŸ”¹ dotenv

ğŸ”¹ cors

ğŸ”¹ MongoDB

ğŸ”¹ firebase-admin

ğŸ’¡ Why Use These?

With these NPX commands, you can jump straight into coding features instead of wasting time on repetitive setup tasks.

âš¡ One command. Full power. Full stack.
